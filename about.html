## About

A self-taught software engineer, I am passionate about learning and implementing stable, modern code.
I've been active in various volunteer organizations, serving as team lead for [Code for San Francisco](http://codeforsanfrancisco.org)'s 
Website and Tools Team, facilitating the [Node.js Website Working group](https://nodejs.org) for over 6 months, and spearheading
[Brigadehub](http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/infrastructure), a proposed CMS for Code for America volunteer brigades. 

I've published numerous active NPM modules, and am constantly looking for more projects to chip in on. 
I know where I got my start, so I strive to help new-comers to the development world get their bearings, 
while trying to push for an increased awareness of the social and civic impact of coding. I know that 
code can't solve everything, but I intend to use my skills the best I can to help others.
